					"Product Description: BreachLock will employ phishing techniques to attempt to convince Company personnel to provide sensitive information. BreachLock will craft an email designed to trick Company personnel into providing credentials or other pieces of sensitive information. The company will provide a list of email addresses to be used by BreachLock as targets. In conjunction with the email, the attack scenario may also include BreachLock creating a malicious website that resembles a legitimate Company employee-related portal or use a cross-site scripting vulnerability in a legitimate Company site if one was identified during a previous phase of this overall assessment. A Phishing assessment include the following common elements: An email will be sent to the target account(s) attempting to make the end-user visit a phishing website and submit their credentials or replying to the phishing email with their credentials. The target will visit the phishing website and attempt to log in by submitting their credentials. The credentials will be logged to a secure location on the phishing server. The target will be redirected to a page telling them their credentials were invalid, or to the valid login screen or webpage that the phishing site was modeled after. Once the target's credentials have been captured, the BreachLock team can use them to attempt to gain further access into the Company's network. Once credentials have been obtained, BreachLock will move forward with the phishing element by attempting to validate the credentials against externally available login portals. This will give Company a more accurate measure of the risk associated with phishing attacks by showing what can be accessed with a given user's credentials.

					"BreachLock shall test up to 1 SSD Product Description BreachLock follows a four-step Methodology combining various reconnaissance and attack techniques to discover weaknesses in the target wireless network and simulate attack scenarios. Discovery In the first step of wireless penetration testing, we apply different techniques to collect as much information as possible about the wireless network. Some of the techniques we use are listed below: Wireless Fingerprinting: In this technique, we scan the wireless network to discover target access points (AP). We also find out the broadcast name and Wi-Fi mac addresses of AP. We gather information on what type of encryption and ciphers are used by the network. Encryption examples: WEP, WPA, WPA2 Ciphers examples: psk, aes, tpk Information Leakage: In this technique, we try to sniff the network traffic over WiFi using tools such as Wireshark and Ettercap to collect any sensitive data that is useful for further attack Encryption Breaking In this step, we apply the information collected in the discovery phase, in combination with various techniques to break the encryption of the wireless network. Fragmentation Attack: By conducting a fragmentation attack, we obtain up to 1500 bytes of PRGA (Pseudo Random Generation Algorithm). This attack does not reveal the WEP key but just fetches the PRGA. Once the PRGA is obtained, it can be used to generate packets that are then leveraged for various wireless injection attacks. Encryption Cracking: In this technique, we send de-authentication packets to the connected users to de-authenticate them from the connected routers to capture the handshake, which is later used for cracking the password. Wireless Sniffing: In this technique, we use tools like Wireshark and Ettercap to intercept the network to collect sensitive information like passwords for WPA2, if sent in plain text. We also use the mac spoofing technique to see if we can bypass WPA2 authentication by changing our mac address to an already connected user. Authentication Breaking Once connected to the router, we conduct different attacks to break the security like WPA2 and others that provides an additional layer of protection. For this purpose, we deploy different techniques, the most common of which are listed below. De-authentication: In this technique, we send de-authenticated packets to the connected users and force them to disconnect. Once their devices reconnect, we try to capture the two-way handshake and then use tools like hash-cat to crack their passwords. Brute Force: In this technique, we conduct a brute force attack with our dictionary containing most common passwords. In the final step, we deploy various attack techniques to exploit the wireless network. The most common techniques we use are listed as follows. Packet Analysis & Sniffing: In this technique, we intercept and sniff packets that are being transmitted over the wireless network and, sometimes, intercept unencrypted data directly inside of TCP packets. The data collected through this type of application can give key insight into the internal workings of the target network and can help formulate an attack strategy. Wi-Fi Configuration: It is quite common for improperly configured devices to be the root cause of wireless network infiltration. We try to gain access to the admin panel, exploiting configuration issues in access control. We can leverage unpatched Wi-Fi software for exploitation using available CVEs. Vendor Specific Vulnerabilities: In this technique, we try to exploit the already known vulnerability specific to wireless technology vendors such as missing firmware updates in the Wi-Fi router.",
