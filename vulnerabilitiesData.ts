        "One or more network ports were found open on the server. An open port is a TCP or UDP port number that is configured to accept packets, allowing other machines to connect. Open ports are necessary to allow other machines to connect to the server, and closing all open ports is therefore impractical. For example, web servers almost always have ports 80 and 443 open to serve webpages to users over HTTP/HTTPS. Vulnerabilities can arise, however, when a port is open unnecessarily without the knowledge of system administrators. Insecure/misconfigured software listening on ports (which may include debugging tools left over from development) can offer attackers a way in to a system.",

      description:
        'The web application is vulnerable to a Host header attack. A web server commonly hosts several web applications at the same IP address, referring to each application via its "virtual host". To request a specific web application, a client must specify a value in the "Host" request header, indicating which web appication they would like to access. For example, for a web server hosting both example1.com and example2.com at a single IP address, a client must specify either "example1.com" or "example2.com" in the Host request header to access the application they require. If the Host request header value is not properly validated, an attacker can supply a malicious value to cause the web server to exhibit dangerous behavior. For example, it may: dispatch requests to the incorrect virtual host (often the first one in its internal virtual hosts list); redirect to an attacker-controlled domain; permit web cache poisoning; or allow the attacker to manipulate password reset functionality.',
      recommendation:
        "Remember that the Host request header is user-specified and should not be trusted. Ensure that strict whitelisting is used to validate the Host header.",

To request a specific web application, a client must specify a value in the "Host" request header, indicating which web appication they would like to access. For example, for a web server hosting both example1.com and example2.com at a single IP address, a client must specify either "example1.com" or "example2.com" in the Host request header to access the application they require. If the Host request header value is not properly validated, an attacker can supply a malicious value to cause the web server to exhibit dangerous behavior. For example, it may: dispatch requests to the incorrect virtual host (often the first one in its internal virtual hosts list); redirect to an attacker-controlled domain; permit web cache poisoning; or allow the attacker to manipulate password reset functionality.',

Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) is a standard used to identify the type of content that is being sent over the internet, such as text, image, audio, etc. MIME sniffing occurs when certain browsers attempt to identify the content type of a particular asset by analyzing, or “sniffing” the content of a file to identify specific patterns or signatures that match known MIME type. This action poses a security risk, as attackers can abuse this to trick a browser into interpreting files as different MIME types, executing malicious code on a user’s computer. It also has the potential to lead to information leakage, as MIME sniffing can reveal sensitive information about users’ habits or application asset contents. Inclusion of the X-Content-Type-Options header with the "nosniff" value instructs the browser to accept Content-Type headers returned by the server as authoritative, and not to attempt MIME type sniffing.',

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) describes the process of enabling access to resources from outside the current origin (usually a domain), by relaxing the default same-origin policy (SOP). For instance, if JavaScript embedded in a page at example1.com/home needs to make an API call to example2.com/api, this access would need to be granted by the Access-Control-Allow-Origin HTTP response header served by the web application at example2.com. While CORS can be useful under the right circumstances (for example, for hosting REST APIs accessible to the public) it can open a web application up to cross-domain attacks.

An attacker may be able to exploit this by embedding the web application into a webpage they control and using this to get the user to interact with it without knowing it is embedded in a malicious way.

The X-Frame-Options header is used to indicate whether a browser should be allowed to render a page within another page. It can be used to mitigate clickjacking by setting the value to â€œDENYâ€\x9d which will prevent the embedding of the application in all cases, or to â€œSAMEORIGINâ€\x9d which will only permit embedding by web application hosted at the same origin.

This action poses a security risk, as attackers can abuse this to trick a browser into interpreting files as different MIME types, executing malicious code on a userâ€™s computer. It also has the potential to lead to information leakage, as MIME sniffing can reveal sensitive information about usersâ€™ habits or application asset contents.

        "The web application is potentially vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF). A CSRF vulnerability arises when a web application does not take steps to prevent websites in other browser tabs from triggering actions on behalf of users who are logged in. Without anti-CSRF measures, other websites can execute actions of the attacker's choosing against the web application using the authenticated session of the user. Often, CSRF attacks are aided by social engineering, but this is not always the case. CSRF attacks can have varying levels of impact depending on the privileges of the affected user. A CSRF attack against a regular user may result in deletion of important data, theft of sensitive data or execution of unwanted actions (such as initiating payments). CSRF attacks against administrators may additionally result in compromise of the entire web application. The use of CSRF tokens is by far the most robust way to counteract CSRF attacks. These one-time random strings are served to the user when they request a webpage, often included as hidden fields in HTML forms. When the user submits the form, the associated action is only carried out if a valid CSRF token is included. This ensures that the user requested the webpage initiating the action in the first place, addressing the vulnerability.",
